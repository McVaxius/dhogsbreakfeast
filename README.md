## _functions.lua
its here in the root so you can find it easily.
please enjoy.
Also please note when it was last updated in case you using it to light your dumpsters on fire.

## The !Archived from old SND! is cloned from the old SND repo
This was done because with new-snd the the community scripts part goes offline forever. please enjoy if you need it.
Don't ask for support with those scripts.  they are just there just in case someone wants to touch them.

## Any scripts not in the !Archived from old SND! sections are maintained and will be updated/fixed for new-SND, by me and whoever else decides to throw their garbage into this dumpster fire.
FUTA, frenrider, Deep Ducking, GOON etc are all going to be maintained and updated. as I use them.
